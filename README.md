Step 1: Decide if you want to load a graph or draw your own magnificent graph from scratch


Step 2: Choose a file or start creating your graph.

TSP stands for: find the (not necessarily shortest) path that passes through a given list of Nodes

Everything else in the GUI is self-explanatory

Don't forget to save your beautiful graph.

The yellow dot indicates the direction of the edge!!!!
